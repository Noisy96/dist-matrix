# Distributed calculation simulation using [GridSim](https://simgrid.org/)

## Description
A school assignment where we were tasked with loosely simulating the calculation of the multiplication of two matrices on a distributed system

## SimGrid [ðŸ”—](https://simgrid.org/)
A framework for developing simulators of distributed applications that executed on distributed platforms, which can in turn be used to prototype, evaluate and compare relevant platform configurations, system designs, and algorithmic approaches.

Initialising...
Starting GridSim version 5.0
Entities started.

Creating the calculation units:

[unit0 of user1] is being created
[unit1 of user1] is being created
[unit2 of user1] is being created
[unit3 of user1] is being created
[unit4 of user1] is being created
[unit5 of user1] is being created
[unit6 of user1] is being created
[unit7 of user1] is being created
[unit8 of user1] is being created
[unit9 of user1] is being created

Attaching the created units to the user:

Adding: linkuser1_0
Adding: unit0
Adding: linkuser1_1
Adding: unit1
Adding: linkuser1_2
Adding: unit2
Adding: linkuser1_3
Adding: unit3
Adding: linkuser1_4
Adding: unit4
Adding: linkuser1_5
Adding: unit5
Adding: linkuser1_6
Adding: unit6
Adding: linkuser1_7
Adding: unit7
Adding: linkuser1_8
Adding: unit8
Adding: linkuser1_9
Adding: unit9

Ordering the units to start performing the calculations:
[unit0 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit4 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit6 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit9 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit7 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit3 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit2 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit1 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit8 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit5 of user1] is performing its calculation
[unit0 of user1] completed calculation and array 1 is ready
[unit4 of user1] completed calculation and array 5 is ready
[unit6 of user1] completed calculation and array 7 is ready
[unit9 of user1] completed calculation and array 10 is ready
[unit7 of user1] completed calculation and array 8 is ready
[unit3 of user1] completed calculation and array 4 is ready
[unit2 of user1] completed calculation and array 3 is ready
[unit1 of user1] completed calculation and array 2 is ready
[unit8 of user1] completed calculation and array 9 is ready
[unit5 of user1] completed calculation and array 6 is ready
